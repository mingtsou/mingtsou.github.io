## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/mingtsou/mingtsou.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mingtsou/mingtsou.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### How to Create a New Folder, called "Images"?

Since Git index can only list "files", rather than "folders", you can not create an empty folder inside a Repo. You MUST create some files with a new folder first.  Here is the steps to create a new folder with a README markdown.

1. go to the folder inside which you want to create another folder.
2. click on New file.
3. on the text field for the file name, first write the folder name you want to create, then type /README.md
4. you can add more folders similarly.

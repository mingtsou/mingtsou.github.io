## Welcome to GitHub Pages

You can use the [editor on GitHub](https://github.com/mingtsou/mingtsou.github.io/edit/master/README.md) to maintain and preview the content for your website in Markdown files.

Whenever you commit to this repository, GitHub Pages will run [Jekyll](https://jekyllrb.com/) to rebuild the pages in your site, from the content in your Markdown files.

### Markdown

Markdown is a lightweight and easy-to-use syntax for styling your writing. It includes conventions for

```markdown
Syntax highlighted code block

# Header 1
## Header 2
### Header 3

- Bulleted
- List

1. Numbered
2. List

**Bold** and _Italic_ and `Code` text

[Link](url) and ![Image](src)
```

For more details see [GitHub Flavored Markdown](https://guides.github.com/features/mastering-markdown/).

### Jekyll Themes

Your Pages site will use the layout and styles from the Jekyll theme you have selected in your [repository settings](https://github.com/mingtsou/mingtsou.github.io/settings). The name of this theme is saved in the Jekyll `_config.yml` configuration file.

### How to delete a folder in Github?

You can delete a file using delete button but you cannot directly delete a folder via the web-interface. The way to delete a folder from GitHub.com is to delete every file inside it. Once you delete all files inside a folder.  The folder will no longer exist.

### Website default file is README.md or index.html?

The Github website (io) will check if there is a "index.html" file available.  If this file is available, Github will use the "index.html" as the default web page in this folder.  Otherwise, the README.md will be the default webpage.
